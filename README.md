# Countdown Timer App ⏳

**Countdown Timer** is an Android application designed to help users track the time remaining until important events. The app allows users to create and manage countdown timers for various events, providing a clear and customizable interface to keep track of upcoming deadlines, special occasions, or personal goals. 🎉📅

## The Why and Beyond 🔍

If you've seen my recent projects, you'll notice that one of my main goals was to create an app to track sleep (for an in-depth explanation, check out the [README](https://github.com/Collins-kariuk/Sleep-Tracker-App) of the Sleep Tracker app). I envisioned a simplified version of Bevel or your favorite sleep tracker app. However, as I started developing the sleep tracker, I quickly realized I was in over my head. Creating a sleep tracker as a beginner developer is quite challenging, so I decided to pivot to a simpler project that was still related to sleep tracking. That's how the Countdown Timer app was born. Coincidentally, I found some guidance and inspiration from this [website](https://www.codementor.io/projects/mobile/countdown-mobile-app-bjzn08zcon). Developing this app has been a challenging but incredibly rewarding experience. I've enjoyed every moment of coding and thinking about this project. My plan is to complete this project before revisiting the sleep tracker. If you have any mobile development resources, please send them my way, and feel free to contribute to this project! 🚀💻

## Status 🚧

The project is nearly complete, but I've decided to temporarily pause development to focus on reviewing quantum mechanics. I plan to return and finish the app soon. ⏸️🔬

## Features 🌟

- **Create Countdown Events**: Users can create countdown events by specifying the event name, date, time, notes, and location. 🗓️
- **Event Management**: Edit or delete existing countdown events with ease. ✏️🗑️
- **Real-Time Countdown**: The app provides a live countdown display for each event, updating every second. ⏱️

## Tech Stack ⚙️

- **Kotlin**: The primary programming language used for the Android app. 🟣
- **Jetpack Compose**: Used for building the UI, providing a modern, declarative approach to creating the user interface. 🎨
- **Room Database**: Manages local data storage, allowing users to save, retrieve, update, and delete countdown events. 🗃️
- **ViewModel**: Manages UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way, ensuring data is retained across configuration changes. 📊
- **Coroutines**: Provides a streamlined way to handle asynchronous tasks, like loading events from the database or updating countdown timers. 🌀

## Project Structure 🗂️

- **`com.example.countdown_timer_app`**: The main package containing all the source code.
  - **`data`**: Contains the `Event` data class, representing the countdown events stored in the database. 📋
  - **`ui`**: Contains UI-related components like the event detail screen and app bar. 🖼️
  - **`viewmodel`**: Contains the `EventViewModel` and `EventViewModelFactory`, which handle the business logic and interaction with the database. 🧠
  - **`database`**: Contains the Room database setup and DAO interface for accessing event data. 🏛️

## Installation 🛠️
